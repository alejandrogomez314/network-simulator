# Nodes
This project contains a simple Go web server/client that will be copied over to the user end nodes in the network simulation. It sends/recieves JSON data using standard http GET and POST.

Ensure your system has Go toolchain installed. To start the web server: `go run .`

To run tests, ensure you have `ripgrep` installed, then run `./tests.sh`.
